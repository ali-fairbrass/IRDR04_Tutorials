# # #  Exercises # # #

# Exercise 1
# Create a high quality plot using the datafile: Nelson.csv  

# Exercise 2
# Load a new dataset mussel.csv
# data are derived from Peake and Quinn (1993) and analyse in Quinn and Keough 2002 and Logan 2010
# The study investigated abundance-area effects for invertebrates living in mussel beds in intertidal areas
# 25 mussel beds
# respone = number of invertebrates (INDIV)
# Explanatory = the area of each clump (AREA)
# additional possible response - Species richness of invertebrates (SPECIES)
# Logan models abundance but we're going to look at species richness

# a) Plot the data and assess whether a linear regression is appropriate.

# b) Fit a linear model of AREA against SPECIES. What do the results of the model tell you about 
# the relationship between area and species richness?

# c) Apply a log transformation to the AREA variable (as it is not normally distributed)
# and re-run the model.

# d) Use appropriate plots to check which model fits the assumptions of linear regression better.
# Explain your answer.

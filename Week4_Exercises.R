# # #  Exercises # # #

# Exercise 1
# Ten people have their height and weight measured
# Create a dataframe with their data
# Person  Height (cm)   Weight (kg)
# 1       140           50
# 2       171           73
# 3       162           52
# 4       159           50
# 5       169           57
# 6       175           80
# 7       168           64
# 8       145           47
# 9       175           86
# 10      180           86



# Exercise 2
# Calculate the total, mean, median, standard deviation and variance for your height and weight data
# Create a new dataframe with these summary statistics
# Export you dataframe with only the height and weight descriptive statistics to a csv file called "summaryStatistics.csv" in your working directory



# Exercise 3
# Create a new dataset of height and weight data for 30 study participants. 
# The data must be normally distributed. 
# The height data must have a mean of 170 and standard deviation of 15.
# The weight data must have a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 10.
# Make sure you can make the dataset again, so your experiment is repeatable.



# Exercise 4
# Generate histograms and density plots of your study participants' characteristics
# Do some googling and play around with changing the appearance of these plots e.g. title, axis labels, colour, histogram breaks



# Exercise 5
# Create a csv file of your study participants' data and save it in your working directory.



# Exercise 6
# Assume that a waiting time of patients in a hospital waiting room is normally distributed 
# with a mean of 50 mintues and a standard deviation of 15 minutes

# a) Generate a density plot of the distribution of the waiting time data.
# Again play arouns with making he plot look a bit nicer


# b) Compute the probability that a patient (who is going to be randomly selected)
# will need to wait less than 45 minutes


# c) Compute the probability that a patient (who is going to be randomly selected)
# will need to wait for between 30 and 60 minutes

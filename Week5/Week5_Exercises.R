# # #  Exercises # # #

# Exercise 1
# You want to investigate whether the academic performance of a group of school children changed
# significantly after they experienced the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami

# There are 130 children in your study. Before the event they had a mean test score of 100 with a 
# standard deviation of 10. After the event their mean score was 85 with a standard deviation of 11.

# A) Create a dataframe of your data.

# B) Check the assumptions of parametric testing and justify your choice of a statistical test.

# C) Use an appropriate statistical test to draw a conclusion about the students test scores
# before and after the event. Report the results of your test appropriately.


# Exercise 2
# You want to investigate whether the happiness of men changes significantly with age.
# You survey a group of 15 men at age 20 and then at age 35, and ask them on a scale of 1 to 5 
# how happy they feel, from 1 = very unhappy to 5 = very happy. Here are the results:
# Men aged 20 happiness scores: 4,5,3,4,5,5,2,4,3,3,4,5,2,1,4
# Men aged 35 happiness scores: 3,4,5,5,1,1,3,2,2,4,2,5,3,3,2

# A) Create a dataframe for this data

# B) Justify why a parametric test would not be approporaite for your investigation.

# C) Using a boxplot assess whether there is likely to be a significant difference between the 
# happiness scores of the men at age 20 and 35.

# D) Using an approporiate statistical test draw a conclusion about the happiness of aging men.
# Report the results of your test appropriately.

# E) If we surveyed the same group of men again when they were 50, what would be the appropriate test
# to investigate differences in happiness at 20, 35 and this third age point? Why?
